# Volt XA

A cognitive architecture rebuilt from the ground up.

**Status:** Planning phase — no active code yet.

## Approach

Volt XA is a clean-room rebuild informed by the lessons of
[Volt X](archive/). Every feature, from the highest-level architecture
to the smallest implementation detail, will be thoroughly planned before
development begins.

The `archive/` directory contains the complete Volt X source code and
documentation as a read-only reference.

## What's Here

```
archive/         ← Volt X reference (50K lines of Rust, design docs)
```

New project files (ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, Cargo.toml, crates/, etc.)
will be created once the design is finalized.
